            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>This project's goal is to recognize and locate cubes in images with traditional edge detecting methods and graphics fundamentals.</p>
            <p>In these images, the position and orientation of the camera isn't known, however the FOV is constant.

                There are several different approaches I explored in order to achieve decent results.</p>
            <h3>Finding faces and using Perspective N-Point solvers.</h3>
            <p>
            The first method consisted of constructing a planar graph out of the edges of the image, finding cube faces by searching for loops in the graph, applying the PNP solver on these faces, and consolidating the results.
            </p>
            <h3>
            Finding the vanishing points of the image
            </h3><p>
            I've explored modelling the vanishing points for an image of a voxel world (grid aligned cubes) in order to find the camera parameters, and then applying the previous face localizing method, but also finding the distance and angle to each detected edge manually.
            
            A graphics engine based in modernGL was also used in order to generate simple testing images for this problem.
